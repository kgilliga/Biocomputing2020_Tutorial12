#Exercise 10
#Question 1:
#Find some data on two variables that you would expect to be related to each other, and then save a text file
#Write a script that loads this text file and produces a scatter plot of those two variables that includes a trend line.



#Question 2:
#Given the data in “data.txt”. Write a script that generates two figures that sumamrize the data. 
#First, show a barplot of the means of the four populations. 
#Second, show a scatter plot of all of the observations. 
#You may want to “jitter” the points (geom_jitter()) to make it easier to see all of the observations within a population in your scatter plot.
#Alternatively, you could also try setting the alpha argument in geom_scatterplot() to 0.1. 
#Do the bar and scatter plots tell you different stories? Why?
